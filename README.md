# TransitTrack

TransitTrack is a Bus Journey Management System with two distinct user interfaces: **Driver Interface** and **Client Interface**. The system allows drivers to manage their bus journeys, including live tracking, status updates, and journey completion. Meanwhile, clients can track bus statuses, select bus journeys, and adjust their travel preferences.

## Features

2. **View Assigned Bus**: After logging in, the driver can see the bus assigned to them for the journey.
3. **Start the Journey**: The driver can start the journey, which will begin live tracking via geolocation.
4. **Pause the Journey**: The driver can pause the journey at any point.
5. **Mark Journey as Completed**: When the journey is completed, the driver can mark it as finished.
6. **Live Tracking**: As the journey is in progress, the driver's location is continuously tracked and recorded in the database.
